    "The top 5 cost drivers for the Customer Service business unit in FY25, based on actual IT costs, are primarily driven by IT services:\n\n1.  **ALM / Dev Collaboration:** $1,546,505.20\n2.  **Enterprise Data Platform:** $1,393,600.6\n3.  **HCM Platform:** $1,186,216.83\n4.  **Intranet / Portal:** $1,129,849.14\n5.  **ERP Procurement Platform:** $946,825.64\n\nWhile specific applications also contribute to costs, the services listed above represent the highest aggregated expenditures for the Customer Service business unit in FY25.\n\n*Note: Information regarding year-over-year changes and root causes for cost differences cannot be determined from the provided data.*",

    "In FY25, the **Procurement** business unit had the highest total IT costs, amounting to **17,163,702.35**.\n\nWhile the specific root cause for Procurement's top position in FY25 is not explicitly detailed, contextual documents indicate a general 5.00% price increase for Microsoft 365 licenses in FY25 due to vendor adjustments. Additionally, the Procurement unit utilizes SAP S/4HANA, which in FY24 focused on stability and operational excellence with its cost structure aligned to a global vendor framework agreement.",
    "The main IT cost drivers for the HR organization in FY25 are:\n\n1.  **Applications Tower:** This is the dominant cost category, accounting for approximately **$11.26 million** of the total IT spend.\n2.  **RUN Costs:** Over 99% of HR's IT spend in FY25, totaling approximately **$16.83 million**, is allocated to \"RUN\" activities, indicating a primary focus on maintaining existing systems rather than new projects or enhancements.\n3.  **Top Services:** The most significant individual service cost drivers are:\n    *   **ALM / Dev Collaboration:** ~$1.93 million\n    *   **Enterprise Data Platform:** ~$1.74 million\n    *   **HCM Platform:** ~$1.48 million\n    *   **Intranet / Portal:** ~$1.39 million\n    *   **ERP Procurement Platform:** ~$1.18 million\n    *   **Identity & Access Mgmt:** ~$1.17 million\n    *   **Collaboration:** ~$1.14 million\n\n**Year-over-Year Changes and Root Causes:**\n\n*   **Microsoft 365 related services (e.g., Collaboration, Intranet/Portal):** Costs for these services may have increased by **5.00%** in FY25 compared to FY24. This change is attributed to vendor pricing adjustments or a new license model for Microsoft 365.\n*   **ERP Procurement Platform:** The cost structure for this platform is aligned with a global vendor framework agreement. Any cost changes are likely driven by the terms of this agreement rather than major feature additions or internal changes.\n*   A substantial portion of the HR IT spend (approximately $16.83 million) is currently categorized as **\"Unassigned IT Project,\"** which aligns with the high \"RUN\" cost. This indicates a lack of granular project-level cost allocation for operational expenses.",

No other specific top cost drivers for R&D's IT spending are identified.\n*   **Year-over-Year Changes:** Comparative data for R&D's IT spending in FY24 is not available, therefore, year-over-year changes for the R&D unit's total IT spending cannot be calculated.",

These differences likely stem from variations in user count, IT infrastructure scale, local vendor contracts, and specific project initiatives within each country.

Germany's IT costs are approximately 36.1% greater than those of the United States.\n\n**Key Cost Drivers & Year-over-Year Changes:**\n*   **Microsoft 365:** A notable cost driver for FY25 is a **5.00% price increase** for Microsoft 365 compared to FY24. This adjustment is attributed to vendor pricing changes or new license models.\n*   **SAP S/4HANA Procurement:** For FY24, SAP S/4HANA Procurement costs remained stable with no major feature additions or significant changes to the cost structure, which was aligned with a global vendor framework agreement.
